*** SPECIAL INTEGRATION ***
===========================

First you need to get the 1D soft-drop mass functional form.
The following code does it for 2017 anti-tag data and QCD, in the HT1500-2500 bin:

An example of the fitting:
https://github.com/joseph-taylor/NTupler/blob/joeTestEdit_master/PATNTupler/macros/plotting_compareDifferentCuts.cc#L167

When the fit is performed, it will print the 16 params to the terminal.
They need inserting in the script: macros/integrate.py
Copy the following format: https://github.com/joseph-taylor/NTupler/blob/joeTestEdit_master/PATNTupler/macros/integrate.py#L219-L238

In the above example, the corresponding F_i factors are be calculated at the bottom like so:
https://github.com/joseph-taylor/NTupler/blob/joeTestEdit_master/PATNTupler/macros/integrate.py#L397
when running $ python integrate.py

Results can be input into: interface/QcdSidebandCorr.h
