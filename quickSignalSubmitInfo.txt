Because there are 60+ different signal mass points. This makes all the data processing stages described in workflowOutline.txt rather laborious.
Fortunately, for each stage we have a work around.
Unfortunately, the work around is a bit nasty.

ALL THESE WORKAROUNDS USE INFO IN: batchJobs/SignalMonteCarloDict.py
(they loop through the relevant dictionaries)

These explanations have the same numerical index as in workflowOutline.txt

1a: miniAOD ---> ntuples
========================
code: plugins/quickSignalSubmit_crab.py
execution (do from plugins directory): $ python quickSignalSubmit_crab.py <yearOfRun>

Have everything setup as normal... BUT, in relevant crab config...
a. include NAMEXYZ in the uniqueName. E.g. uniqueName = 'NAMEXYZ_CMSSW8029wDBTV4_9b0ff8'
b. use DATASETXYZ for the dataset name. E.g. config.Data.inputDataset = 'DATASETXYZ'
^For example see: https://github.com/joseph-taylor/NTupler/blob/ralDemoMaster/PATNTupler/plugins/crabConfig_nTupleProd_VJ.py


1b: making ntuple filelists
===========================
code: batchJobs/quickSignalSubmit_filelists.py
execution (from batchJobs directory): $ python quickSignalSubmit_filelists.py <yearOfRun>

Make sure that in batchJobs/makeFileLists.py ...
the motherDirs and outputFileList contain NAMEXYZ


2: ntuples ---> flatTrees
=========================
code: main/quickSignalSubmit_flatTrees.py
execution (from main directory): $ python quickSignalSubmit_flatTrees.py <yearOfRun>

Make sure that in main/submitCondorNtupleJobs_VJ.py ...
inputFileListPath and outputDirectory contain NAMEXYZ
(note that these jobs will still need setting off)


3b: flatTrees ---> histos
=========================
code: quickSignalSubmit_histos.py
OR: quickSignalSubmit_histos_SQUARKONLY.py (uses squarkSamples dictionary in SignalMonteCarloDict.py)
execution (from macros directory): $ python quickSignalSubmit_histos.py <yearOfRun>
OR: python quickSignalSubmit_histos_SQUARKONLY.py

make sure that in macros/histos_create.cc ...
you use SLIMXYZ in outputdir
you use NAMEXYZ for the flatTree location
you use 987654321.0 for the cross section
